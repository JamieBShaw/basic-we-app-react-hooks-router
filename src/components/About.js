			<h2> About Us</h2>
			<p>
				Put life in perspective with some short yet sage pieces of advice. These
				wise and beautiful words from your favorite positive thinkers will get
				you in the right mindset to tackle whatever obstacles lie ahead.
				Inspirational quotes from successful people like Oprah, Helen Keller,
				and Maya Angelou can help you reframe negative thoughts during tough
				times and change your attitude so you feel refreshed and motivated.
				Whether you're hoping to achieve success at work, home, or life in
				general, establishing the right intentions can help you stay positive
				and optimistic during the challenges fate can throw your way. If you're
				short on time, there's no need to dig through your favorite books for a
				little pick-me-up. These inspirational quotes for life and success will
				resonate (and fit on your Pinterest board). Authors, scientists,
				philosophers, and other famous celebrities have revealed the inner
				mantras that helped them achieve their goals, and these sayings could
				help you as well. Many focus on embracing what they can control and
				letting go of what they can't — a helpful approach when you're feeling
				anxious or overwhelmed. Others frame everything in terms of what they
				can give to others, which can put obstacles in perspective. Some people
				just try to celebrate the joys of life whenever they can — a reminder
				many of us could stand to hear more. No matter what you're feeling or
				experiencing, here's hoping these short inspirational quotes can help
				you get where you want to go.
